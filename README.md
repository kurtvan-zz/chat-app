Then clone the repository into a local directory and finally install [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html), and [socket.io](http://socket.io/download/) into that directory.

now run :

`node app.js`

and the app should be running!

##Usage

You can test the app by visiting `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Snoop around in data.json to find the valid users.
